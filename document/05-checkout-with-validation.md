In this session we will add the feautures where users are able to add delivery address and we will also validate it.

### Validating Input

We can not leave the address form empty, since we need an address to deliver the pizza to. Therefore, we will add validation to the inputs.

When the inputs are empty the inputs will turn red. and the `place order` button can not be clicked.
